/* This implements shared memory based on POSIX mmap.  We start with
   memory block of the size of the global shared memory data, rounded
   up to one pagesize, and enlarge as needed.

   We address the memory via a shared_memory_ptr, which is an offset into
   the shared memory block. The metadata is situated at offset 0.

   In order to be able to resize the memory and to keep pointers
   valid, we keep the old mapping around, so the memory is actually
   visible several times to the process.  Thus, pointers returned by
   shared_memory_get_mem_with_alignment remain valid even when
   resizing.  */
