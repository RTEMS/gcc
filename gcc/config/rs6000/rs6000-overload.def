; Overloaded built-in functions in this file are organized into "stanzas",
; where all built-ins in a given stanza have the same overloaded function
; name:
;
;   [<overload-id>, <abi-name>, <builtin-name>]
;
; Here the square brackets are part of the syntax, <overload-id> is a
; unique internal identifier for the overload that will be used as part
; of an enumeration of all overloaded functions; <abi-name> is the name
; that will appear as a #define in altivec.h; and <builtin-name> is the
; name that is overloaded in the back end.
;
; Each function entry has two lines.  The first line is a prototype line.
; See rs6000-builtin-new.def for a description of the prototype line.
; A prototype line in the file differs in that it doesn't have an
; optional [kind] token:
;
;   <return-type> <internal-name> (<argument-list>);
;
; The second line contains only one token: the <bif-id> that this
; particular instance of the overloaded function maps to.  It must
; match a token that appears in rs6000-builtin-new.def.
;
; Blank lines may be used as desired in this file between the lines as
; defined above; that is, you can introduce as many extra newlines as you
; like after a required newline, but nowhere else.  Lines beginning with
; a semicolon are also treated as blank lines.
